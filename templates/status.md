# Run Status

## State Machine (Two-Pipeline Architecture)

```
CREDENTIALS_VERIFIED → NEW → PLANNED → SPEC_READY → PIPELINES_COMPLETE → DOCUMENTED → REVIEW_PASSED → READY_TO_SHIP → DONE
```

- `SPEC_READY` requires `comprehension.md`, `spec.md`, AND `test-spec.md` from planner
- `PIPELINES_COMPLETE` requires BOTH `implementation.md` (builder) AND `audit.md` (tester)
- Builder (and simulator, if applicable) run first after SPEC_READY; tester runs after all writers complete

Interrupt states:
- `HOLD` — waiting for user input (only user can unblock)
- `BLOCKED` — tester validation failed (respawn upstream teammate)
- `STOPPED` — reviewer quality gate failed (respawn per routing)

## Pipeline Isolation Status

| Check | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Builder received only spec.md (not test-spec.md or sim-spec.md) | pending |
| Tester received only test-spec.md (not spec.md or sim-spec.md) | pending |
| Simulator received only sim-spec.md (not spec.md or test-spec.md) | pending |
| Reviewer received ALL artifacts from all pipelines | pending |

## Active Isolation

| Teammate | Isolation | Worktree Path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| builder | worktree | |
| simulator | worktree | |
| scriber | worktree | |

## Open Risks

_No open risks._

## Blocking Reason

_Not blocked._

## Repo Boundary

- Framework repo: StatsClaw (orchestration rules only, no runtime state, no target code changes)
- Target repo: [target repository] (code + user-facing docs only)
- Workspace repo: [user-specified workspace repo] (runtime state + workflow logs + process records)
- Runtime directory: .repos/workspace/[repo-name]/ (runs, logs, tmp)
- Ship target: [target repository]

## Persistence Rule

All state transitions must be written to this file immediately. Only `leader` may update this file.
