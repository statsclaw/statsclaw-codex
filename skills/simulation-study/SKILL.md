# Skill: Simulation Study — Monte Carlo Evaluation of Estimator Properties

This skill enables StatsClaw to automatically design and execute Monte Carlo simulation studies that evaluate the finite-sample properties of statistical estimators. Given a DGP (Data Generating Process) specification and an estimator, it produces simulation code, runs the study, and reports results on consistency, bias, RMSE, coverage, size, and power.

## Trigger Phrases

Any of the following user intents activate this skill. **Exact wording is NOT required** — leader routes semantically:

- "Run a simulation study for this estimator"
- "Study the finite-sample properties of [estimator]"
- "Monte Carlo simulation for [method]"
- "Check consistency/coverage/bias of [estimator]"
- "Simulate DGP and evaluate [estimator]"
- "Run Monte Carlo experiments"
- "What are the small-sample properties?"
- "Evaluate estimator performance via simulation"

A short prompt like `"simulate the finite-sample properties of the new estimator"` is sufficient.

---

## What This Skill Does

1. **Design** — Planner analyzes the estimator and produces a simulation specification (`sim-spec.md`) alongside the standard `spec.md` and `test-spec.md`
2. **Implement** — Builder implements the estimator (code pipeline), Simulator implements the DGP and simulation harness (simulation pipeline), both from independent specs
3. **Execute** — Tester runs the full simulation and validates results against theoretical expectations (test pipeline)
4. **Report** — Scriber records the simulation design, results, and convergence diagnostics
5. **Review** — Reviewer cross-compares all three pipelines for convergence

## Workflows That Use Simulation

### Workflow 11: Simulation Study (New Estimator)

**Trigger**: User requests implementation of a new estimator AND wants simulation evidence of its properties.

**Agent Sequence**:
```
leader → planner → [builder ∥ simulator] → tester → scriber → reviewer → shipper?
```

**What happens**:
1. Planner produces THREE specs: `spec.md` (estimator implementation), `test-spec.md` (unit tests + simulation validation), `sim-spec.md` (DGP + scenario grid + metrics)
2. Builder implements the estimator from `spec.md` (in worktree) — runs in parallel with simulator
3. Simulator implements the DGP and simulation harness from `sim-spec.md` (in worktree) — runs in parallel with builder
4. After both builder and simulator complete and merge back, tester validates the fully merged code: runs unit tests from `test-spec.md` AND executes the full simulation, comparing results against acceptance criteria
5. Scriber records everything including simulation results tables
6. Reviewer cross-compares all three pipelines

### Workflow 12: Simulation Only (Existing Estimator)

**Trigger**: User wants simulation study for an already-implemented estimator (no code changes needed).

**Agent Sequence**:
```
leader → planner → simulator → tester → scriber → reviewer → shipper?
```

**What happens**:
1. Planner produces TWO specs: `sim-spec.md` (DGP + scenarios) and `test-spec.md` (simulation validation criteria)
2. Simulator implements the DGP and harness from `sim-spec.md` (in worktree)
3. After simulator completes and merges back, tester executes the full simulation and validates from `test-spec.md`
4. Scriber records results
5. Reviewer reviews

No builder is dispatched since the estimator already exists.

### Integration with Existing Workflows

Simulation can also be **added to** standard code workflows (1, 2, 4, 5) when the user's request includes simulation intent. In that case:

- Planner produces all three specs
- Builder AND simulator are dispatched in parallel; after both complete, tester is dispatched
- The rest of the pipeline proceeds normally with the additional `simulation.md` artifact

## Simulation Specification (`sim-spec.md`)

## Three-Pipeline Architecture (With Simulation)

When simulation is active, the two-pipeline architecture extends to three pipelines:

```
                      planner (bridge)
                     /    |          \
          spec.md   / test-spec.md    \  sim-spec.md
                   /      |            \
            builder ─ ─(parallel)─ ─ simulator
       (code pipeline)    |    (simulation pipeline)
                   \      |            /
      implementation.md   |   simulation.md
                    \     |          /
                     \    v         /
                       tester           <-- sequential, after merge-back
                    (test pipeline)
                         |
                      audit.md
                         |
                    scriber (recording)
                         |
                    reviewer (convergence)
                         |
                       shipper
```

**Key properties**:
1. Builder and simulator are dispatched in PARALLEL (both in the same message). Tester is dispatched AFTER both complete and merge back.
2. Builder receives ONLY `spec.md`
3. Simulator receives ONLY `sim-spec.md`
4. Tester receives ONLY `test-spec.md` (which includes simulation validation criteria)
5. Tester validates the fully merged code — both the unit tests AND the simulation results
6. Pipeline isolation is maintained across all three pipelines

---

## Tester's Role in Simulation Workflows

In simulation workflows, tester has expanded responsibilities:

1. **Unit test validation** — standard test scenarios from `test-spec.md`
2. **Full simulation execution** — run the simulation harness with full replications (R = 2000+)
3. **Result validation** — compare simulation outputs against acceptance criteria from `test-spec.md`
4. **Convergence verification** — check that metrics converge as N grows

Tester's `test-spec.md` includes a dedicated **Simulation Validation** section (produced by planner) that specifies:
- Expected convergence patterns
- Exact acceptance thresholds for each metric
- How to interpret the simulation output tables

Tester produces the simulation results tables in `audit.md`, along with pass/fail assessments for each acceptance criterion.

---

## Reviewer's Role in Simulation Workflows

Reviewer cross-compares THREE pipelines:

1. **Code ↔ Test convergence**: Does the implementation match the test expectations?
2. **Simulation ↔ Theory convergence**: Do the finite-sample properties match theoretical predictions?
3. **Code ↔ Simulation consistency**: Does the estimator behave the same in unit tests and simulation?
4. **DGP correctness**: Is the DGP implementation faithful to `sim-spec.md`?

Reviewer checks:
- Simulation results are within acceptance thresholds
- Convergence rates match theory (e.g., √N-consistency)
- No suspicious patterns (e.g., coverage exactly at nominal — suggests test is not discriminating)
- Simulator did not read `spec.md` or `test-spec.md` (pipeline isolation)
- Tester did not read `sim-spec.md` or `spec.md` (pipeline isolation)

---

## Safety Rules

- **Honest reporting**: Simulator MUST report all results honestly, including unfavorable ones. Cherry-picking scenarios or replications is forbidden.
- **No tolerance inflation**: Neither simulator nor tester may relax acceptance criteria to make results pass.
- **Reproducibility**: All simulation code MUST produce identical results when re-run with the same seeds.
- **Resource awareness**: For large simulation grids, estimate total computation time in `simulation.md` and warn if it exceeds 1 hour.
- **Pipeline isolation**: Simulator never sees `spec.md` or `test-spec.md`. The simulation study is designed from mathematical principles (`sim-spec.md`), not from knowledge of implementation details.

---

## Example User Prompts

All of these should trigger simulation workflows:

```
"Implement the panel data estimator from the paper and run Monte Carlo simulations"
"Study the finite-sample properties of the new robust estimator"
"Run a simulation study: DGP is linear model with heteroskedastic errors, evaluate OLS vs GLS"
"Check if the confidence intervals have correct coverage for small samples"
"Monte Carlo: test consistency and coverage of the bootstrap estimator"
"Evaluate the new method's bias and RMSE across different sample sizes"
```
